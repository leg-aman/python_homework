1. Static visualizations are like pictures — they show only one view of the data and can’t be changed. They can be boring and limited. Interactive visualizations are more fun and useful because users can click, zoom, and explore different parts of the data on their own.
2. Dashboards are great for checking live data quickly. They let users see updates as they happen and explore the data easily, all in one place. This helps in making fast and smart decisions.
3. Plotly and Dash are tools that help create interactive visualizations and dashboards. They make it easy to turn data into visual stories that people can understand and use.
