While I was working on Assignment 9, I came across a challenge that I couldn't solve initially. I had a hard time understanding the problem and figuring out how to approach it. I tried to break it down into smaller parts and tackle each one individually. By asking questions and using additional resources, I was eventually able to resolve all my doubts. I learned a lot from this experience, and it helped me improve my problem-solving skills.
